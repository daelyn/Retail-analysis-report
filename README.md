Mission

Amazon recently launched the Amazon Prime service and are offering $20,000 bonus to the employee in the data science 
team that develops the most comprehensive analysis of the shoppers using this data. They are trying to understand the market to 
better target shoppers.

This report includes the code and an explanatory text for each of the following:

Objective of the Project:  Describe in your own words the objective of the research in 3 paragraphs or more.

Data Exploration: Describe your data with code (and text) for at least4 different aspects of your data.

Merge: Create a new dataset called 'sales_all' that contains all columns of the Feature dataset merged with the other

Features datasate and the sales is the Date. Similarly, the common field between the Features dataset and the stores dataset is 
the store number.

Simple Linear Regression: Make 5 models of simple linear regression to try and predict the weekly sales. Try to answer questions 
such as: "How well can temperatures predict the weekly sales?". Interpret the results of each model with explanatory text

Model Comparison: Compare each of the models in 4) and decide which one is better.

Multiple Linear Regression: Try now to, again, predict the weekly sales, but using more than one variable. Try different scenarios, 
compare your models and pick the best. Explain in words the interpretation of each of your models. Compare the multiple regression 
result with the simple regression result.

Summary of the findings: explain in words what you have found in the dataset in 2 paragraphs or more.
